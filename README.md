**Deep Learning and Machine Learning Practical Applications**

Welcome to my repository showcasing practical applications of Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Below are several projects demonstrating the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Time Series Analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Collaborative Filtering.

**Projects**

**Predicting Car Sales with Artificial Neural Networks**
  
  In this project, I utilized Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict car sales based on various features such as economic indicators, marketing efforts, and customer demographics.

**Image Classification with Deep Neural Networks**
  
  Using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), I developed a model capable of accurately classifying images into predefined categories. This project demonstrates the application of DNNs in tasks such as image recognition and classification.

**Traffic Sign Classification using LeNet Deep Network**
  
  I implemented the LeNet Deep Network architecture to classify traffic signs in images. This project showcases the effectiveness of deep learning in real-world applications such as traffic sign recognition systems.

**Transfer Learning for Image Classification**
  
  By employing Transfer Learning techniques, I adapted pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images in a different domain. This project demonstrates the efficiency of leveraging pre-trained models for tasks with limited data.

**Crime Prediction with Prophet Time Series Analysis**
  
  Using Facebook's Prophet library, I developed a time series model to predict crime rates based on historical data. This project highlights the application of time series analysis in predicting and understanding patterns in crime data.

**Market Condition Forecasting with Prophet Time Series Analysis**
  
  Similar to the crime prediction project, I used Prophet to forecast market conditions based on historical trends and external factors. This project demonstrates the versatility of time series analysis in financial forecasting.

**Natural Language Processing for Reviews Analysis**
  
  I developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to analyze and categorize reviews based on sentiment and content. This project illustrates the use of NLP techniques for extracting insights from textual data.

  
**Spam Filter using Natural Language Processing**
  
  Utilizing NLP techniques such as text classification, I built a spam filter capable of identifying and filtering out unwanted emails. This project showcases the practical application of NLP in email filtering systems.

**Recommender System with User-Based Collaborative Filtering**
  
  By implementing user-based Collaborative Filtering algorithms, I developed a recommender system capable of generating personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behavior.
